The varied tapestry of the tallgrass, mixed-grass, and short-grass prairies reaches from the eastern woodlands and oak savannas to the foothills of the Rockies. Grasses and wildflowers make good use of limited rainfall, and fire helps sustain the ecosystem. Prairies provide habitats for many animals, including the pronghorn &mdash; North America's' fastest land animal &mdash; and the prairie dog, one of many burrowing animals that live on the prairies

Settlers' steel plows altered the landscape and transformed life on the prairies.

Native prairie is rare today; remaining patches exist because of careful management and diligent preservation efforts.
